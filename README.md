# Blockly Learning App (Flutter + Blockly)
This is a college project where I built a Duolingo-style mobile learning application using Flutter, wrapped around Google’s Blockly library.

The goal of this project was to create an engaging and structured platform for learning programming through block-based coding, designed for students who are ready for more than beginner-level tools.

## Background and Motivation

### What is Blockly?

Blockly is a block-based JavaScript library developed by Google.

- It enables users to build programs using visual blocks.
- It supports multiple programming languages.
- Although community support and documentation are limited, it includes most of the fundamental constructs required to teach programming concepts.

### Why This Project?

In many schools, beginner-level programming is introduced through Scratch (developed by MIT), which is an excellent platform.

However:

- Scratch is highly child-friendly.
- It may not fully challenge teenage learners who can grasp more advanced programming concepts.

This project aims to:

- Use Blockly as a more flexible and extensible alternative.
- Provide a structured, level-based learning system similar to Duolingo.
- Create a platform suitable for middle and high school students.

### Why Flutter?

Blockly is web-based, but the objective was to build a cross-platform mobile application for:

- Android  
- iOS  

To achieve this:

- Flutter was used as the primary framework.
- Blockly was integrated using Flutter’s WebView component.

This allowed the web-based Blockly editor to run within a native mobile application environment.

### Current State

Porting Blockly into a mobile WebView environment presented several challenges.

- Integration required workarounds in multiple areas.
- Some features require further refinement.
- The project needs structural and performance improvements.

The core functionality is operational to the best, but i will be updatinf the project.
